# Fishin
Fishing RPG Game (Fun Project)

Test game made in Python emulating systems from popular online games such as World of Warcraft or Runescape - specifically the professions or skill systems in these games. 

Mainly just a testing ground for me to muck around with specific file structures and learn python. likely wont go anywhere

Planned - multiple locations, max levels of 100 or higher, items and equipment that can do various things in game, rare fish based on time of day and season, possibly other actions/skills such as hunting or woodworking.
